# UI extensions — design

Status: scope agreed. Review round 1 done
(`docs/tui-extension-design-review.md`). Those fixes are folded in below.

Extends `docs/tui.md`. The event log stays the only truth.
UI extension output is a disposable view, like the transcript.

## 1. Goal

Run the class of UI extensions shown by the pi-config inventory
(`~/programming/pi-config/extensions`):

- tool-result rendering
- a powerline statusline
- shared UI state between extensions
- inline mermaid and LaTeX rendering
- host notifications (terminal bell, OSC)

Each extension is an external process.
One JSONL boundary per extension, over stdio.
The TUI hosts. The extension renders, reacts, and appends.
No extension code compiles into the TUI.

## 2. In scope and out of scope

Seven capabilities:

| Cap | What it does |
|---|---|
| `render` | Replaces built-in rendering of named event kinds |
| `status` | Owns the statusline row |
| `transform` | Rewrites text at render time (mermaid fences, LaTeX spans) |
| `append` | Writes whitelisted event types to the log |
| `notify` | Terminal effects (bell, OSC), applied by the host |
| `frame` | Owns the input-area chrome: border style, the label, and the interior height. The host renders the draft content and the cursor; the extension owns the frame, never the input state |
| `row` | Owns the host-reserved row above the input box (between the working row and the input area): one or more styled lines, or none. The host owns the slot and its position; the extension supplies the content |

Out of scope:

- live widget replacement inside the TUI process (pi's `setEditorComponent`).
  The `frame` capability is the boundary for the input area: an
  extension owns the frame chrome (border, label, height) through a
  declarative spec, never the input state. The TUI always renders the
  draft, the cursor, and the key state; an extension cannot type
  into the draft or intercept a key
- hot reload. The update path is stop, edit, restart (section 9)
- direct extension-to-extension IPC. All shared state flows through the log
- audio output

## 3. Manifest

Location: `ui_extensions/<name>/ext.toml`.

```toml
[ext]
command = "bash"
args = ["statusline.sh"]
caps = ["status"]
kinds = ["tool_result"]
tick_ms = 1000
transform = ["fence:mermaid", "inline:latex"]
append_types = []
protocol_v = 1
```

- `command` — the executable. A bare name resolves on the TUI's
  `PATH`. A relative path resolves against the entry directory.
  An absolute path runs as-is. The host checks the target before
  spawn and refuses a missing one
- `args` — arguments to the command
- `caps` — claimed capabilities
- `kinds` — event types the host forwards. Default: all
- `tick_ms` — cadence for the `status`, `frame`, and `row` ticks
- `transform` — scope-qualified rewrite targets. `fence:mermaid` rewrites
  code blocks of that language. `inline:latex` rewrites `$...$` and
  `$$...$$` spans. The host extracts the span, sends it, replaces it in place
- `append_types` — log event types this extension may append. Default: none
- `protocol_v` — the host checks it before spawn. A mismatch skips the
  extension and flashes
- no ordering field exists in this manifest. Order is host-owned
  (section 6)

The TUI scans the directory at start.
A global directory ships with the harness.
A project directory (`.pi/ui_extensions/`) adds or overrides entries by name.

## 4. Protocol (JSONL over stdio)

TUI to extension:

| op | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event` | one full log event | a new event matching `kinds` |
| `tick` | `{seq, width, session, model, thinking, loop_running, color, statuses}` | cadence ping for status and frame extensions; `color` names the terminal capability level the TUI lowers hex wire colors to (color.rs `Level::name`) |
| `frame` | `{seq, width, session, model, thinking, mode, loop_running}` | cadence ping for the frame extension; the `mode` label and `thinking` level drive its `frame_spec` |
| `row` | `{seq, width, session, model, thinking, mode, loop_running}` | cadence ping for the row extension; the owner replies with the row content (`row_spec`) |
| `transform` | `{req, text, width, scope}` | rewrite one span |

Extension to TUI:

| op | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `lines` | `{event_id, lines}` | styled lines replacing the built-in render of one event |
| `status` | `{lines}` | the statusline row |
| `frame_spec` | `{spec}` | the input-area frame: `{border, label, height}`. The host renders the draft and cursor; a bad `spec` keeps the last valid frame (G5) |
| `row_spec` | `{lines}` | the host-reserved row above the input box. `lines` follows the line-item rules; an empty array hides the row. A bad reply keeps the last valid row (G5) |
| `transformed` | `{req, lines}` | result for the matching `req` |
| `append` | `{event}` | append the event via `SessionPort` |
| `notify` | `{kind: "bell"}` or `{kind: "osc", code, args}` | the host applies it on its own terminal |

`lines` is an array of line items.
A line item is a bare string, a `[text, style]` pair, or an array
of `[text, style]` pairs (a multi-span line; the host draws the
spans left to right on one row).
`style` is `{fg, bg, bold}`. Values are theme tokens or hex strings.
The host converts each span to a `Span::styled`.
No raw ANSI crosses the channel.
`lines` are width-independent. The host wraps to the pane width.
Every message carries `"v": 1`.
A `transformed` reply whose `req` is no longer current is dropped.
Malformed replies never crash the TUI. Fallback is per op
(`docs/refinement-policy.md` G5, `docs/tui.md` section 10 item 4):

- `lines`: fall back to the built-in render
- `status`: keep the last valid row
- `row_spec`: keep the last valid row
- `transformed`: show the raw block
- `append`: reject with a flash naming the reason

History rule: on start, the host re-sends the events of the visible
transcript for `render`. Replies cache by `(ext, event_id)`.
That cache folds into the transcript cache key.
A new log event or a new reply rebuilds the transcript.
At start, the host also re-sends every `assistant_message` with `usage`,
uncapped, to every `status` extension.
Cumulative stats survive a restart from the log alone.

## 5. Vocabulary

- No new `usage` event. `usage` already lives on
  `assistant_message` (`schemas/events/v1/assistant_message.json`).
  The statusline sums those events
- `ext_status` — `{id, value}`: shared UI state (vim mode, team status).
  An extension publishes; the host consumes the ids it owns
  (the input-area border, the working row). This is the log-based
  replacement for pi's `ctx.ui.setStatus`.
  Add it to `EventKind` and to `schemas/events/v1`.
  Suppressed from the transcript by default. The log keeps it.
  Publishers send only on change, not per tick.
  The reference statusline does not list ext_status values:
  shared UI state is host presentation, not footer content
  (2026-09-02 revision). The `statuses` map stays on the tick
  payload for consumers that want it

Id registry — the known `ext_status` ids:

- `model_thinking` — the active model's thinking level (0–4).
  Published by the loop or a policy hook. The loop publishes it
  from the resolved `reasoning_effort` (`scripts/step.sh` via
  `bin/model --describe`; docs/tui-thinking-level-input-box.md).
  The TUI colors the input-area border from the last value.
- `loop_phase` — the active loop's phase: `wait` (the step awaits
  the model response) and `tools` (the step routes tool calls).
  The loop publishes it in `scripts/step.sh` before the phase it
  names (docs/tui-model-wait-indicator.md). The TUI renders the
  last value as the title bit and the working row above
  the input box, gated on the loop-running bit. Old logs hold no
  marker. They fall back to the plain `[running]` bit and the
  `Working...` row.

Policy hooks (the `no-find-grep` class): an extension with
`append_types = ["approval", "ext_status"]` watches `tool_call` and
answers its own `approval_request` with a deny.
First answer wins. The loop and the TUI ignore later duplicates
for the same id.
The TUI stays free of decision logic (`docs/tui.md` section 10.1).
Exact pre-approval blocking semantics is an open item (section 11).

## 6. Layout and load order

Layout:

- the statusline row reserves one line when a `status` extension exists
- without one, the TUI shows its built-in help/status row
- the row extension's lines reserve layout cells between the working
  row and the input box, one cell per line; with no `row` owner, or
  an empty spec, the slot collapses to zero rows
- transformed text renders in place in the transcript

Load order is host-owned. This follows the deepseek-harness loader,
where the core decides the sequence and an entry never claims a slot
(`vendor/loader`: the loader remains the sole lifecycle authority).

- layers compose in a fixed host order: built-in renderers, then the
  global directory, then the project directory
- a project entry overrides a global entry by name
- within a layer, alphabetical by name. The rule is host-fixed and
  deterministic. No manifest field changes it
- `kind` ownership: the first extension in the composed sequence that
  lists the kind owns it
- `status` allows one owner across the whole sequence. Two claimants:
  the host refuses to start and names both
- an extension declares what it needs. It never claims when it runs.
  There is no `priority`, `before`, or `after` field, and none will be
  added
- extension-to-extension needs flow through log data (`ext_status`
  publisher and consumer). A consumer that loads late replays the log.
  Load order is presentation, not correctness. The system is
  order-tolerant
- validation fails loud at scan. A malformed manifest or a broken
  command refuses the start and names the file. A wrong entry is a
  misconfiguration, not a silent skip
- a relative `command` path resolves against the entry directory,
  not the TUI's working directory. A bundled reference binary lands
  next to its `ext.toml` and needs no `PATH` export
- the host owns lifecycle: spawn, restart budget, exit. An extension
  never restarts itself

## 7. Lifecycle

- One process per enabled extension, in its own process group
  (`setsid`), like the loop (`docs/tui.md` section 13.3)
- Quit: SIGTERM the group, wait 3 s, SIGKILL the survivors, and
  wait for the deaths, synchronously on the quit path. The pids are
  re-collected after the escalation: a restart that started during
  the wait is a new group, and the kill covers it. No detached
  reaper: a detached thread dies with the process, and a group that
  ignores SIGTERM would orphan
- Signalled exit: the TUI installs handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT, and
  SIGHUP. Each handler sets a flag. The main loop then runs the same
  stop sequence as a `q` `q` quit, so a signalled quit leaves no
  orphan extensions
- Abnormal exit backstop: the child closes every inherited pipe fd
  before `execvp`. So when the host dies without the stop sequence
  (for example `SIGKILL`), the extension's stdin gets EOF and the
  extension exits on its own
- Restart budget: 3 attempts with 1 s / 2 s / 4 s backoff, then dead.
  The owned row shows a hint
- A slow `transform` times out at 2 s. Fallback is the raw block
- Tick cost note: a bash statusline that spawns `git` on every tick is
  expensive. The reference TTL-caches git calls at 3 s
- Debug log: the host appends one line per extension process event
  (spawn, death with exit code, respawn, stop) to a log file,
  never to stderr. The TUI owns the terminal; a raw stderr write
  bypasses the renderer and pollutes the frame (FT-016). The path
  is `TUI_EXT_LOG` when set, otherwise the default
  `<cache>/tui/ext-host.log` under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or
  `$HOME/.cache` (line format: `pid ms msg`; `ext_log` in
  `bin/tui/src/ext.rs`)

## 8. Reference extensions, in order

1. `statusline` — bash + `git` + `jq`. Proves the point language-agnostic first
2. `tool_result` — a `render` kind owner
3. `mermaid` — a Rust binary on `grok-mermaid` (Unicode art, like pi)
4. `statusline-rs` — Rust port of item 1
5. `frame` — bash. Owns the input-area frame: colors the rounded
   border by the model thinking level and labels it with the editor
   mode. In command-line mode the host search prompt takes the
   title over that label (docs/ui-extension.md section 10).
   Proves the `frame` capability and its trust boundary (chrome
   only, no input state)
6. `goal` — Rust. Owns the reserved row: the goal status line
   (elapsed, token count) while a goal is open, and the armed hint
   while a goal write or edit is pending. Also ships the goal
   palette commands, the hooks, and the goal tools. Proves the
   `row` capability: a host-reserved slot with extension-owned
   content

## 9. Distribution and lifecycle policy

- The mechanism ships inside the TUI binary: host, protocol, spawn,
  supervision
- The default examples are scripts (`statusline`, `tool_result`).
  They add zero compiled binaries on a user machine
- The `mermaid` example ships one opt-in Rust binary. Its manifest
  names the binary by a path relative to its entry
  (`target/debug/mermaid-ext`), so the host resolves it without a
  `PATH` export. Build it once in its directory
  (`cargo build`)
- A project carries only what it uses, in its own directory
- No hot reload (decision). Pi accepts `/reload` only when idle.
  deepseek-harness also restarts for some changes, per user reports.
  The update path is stop, edit, restart. Nothing is lost: the log is
  the truth. Until the daemon phase, restarting the TUI stops the loop
  too (`docs/tui.md` section 12). The daemon removes that coupling

## 10. Guardrails

- The TUI holds no extension logic. It hosts and supervises
- A dead extension degrades a pane, not the log
- The `frame` extension owns the input-area chrome, not the input
  state: a `frame_spec` may set the border style, the label, and the
  interior height, but it cannot type into the draft, move the
  cursor, or capture a key. The host renders the draft content, the
  cursor, and the modal state; a frame spec is a declarative
  description of the border. In command-line mode the host search
  prompt takes the title over a frame label, and the label returns
  when the search ends (docs/vim-editor-design.md section 7). The
  `frame` capability is therefore presentation-level trust, below
  `append` (a log writer). Two frame owners refuse the start, like
  the `status` row
- A `row` owner supplies content, not layout: a `row_spec` is an
  array of styled lines drawn at a host-owned position between the
  working row and the input box. The host reserves the layout and
  collapses the slot when the spec is empty. Two `row` owners
  refuse the start, like the `status` row
- The `docs/tui.md` section 10 forbidden-string scan stays
- Trust: an extension with `append` is a long-lived log writer.
  It holds loop-level trust, not tool-level trust. The tool contract is
  one-shot and never writes the log. `append_types` bounds the blast
  radius. A fake `approval` or `tool_result` is a log-poisoning path.
  The project owner decides who gets `append_types`
- Intentional divergence from the tool spec: that contract is one-shot
  and stateless (`docs/tool-interface-registry-idea_from_human.md`
  section 5). The extension protocol is bidirectional and stateful.
  It is the UI-side twin, not the tool contract

## 11. Decisions and open items

### Settled in stage 4 (ui-extension-plan)

- **Pre-approval semantics: answer one that does.** An extension with
  `append` may append an `approval` that answers an `approval_request`
  that already exists in the log. The pending state is derived from the
  log in order: an `approval` counts only after the request it answers
  (refinement policy G6). Pre-approval blocking (holding the loop on a
  request that does not exist yet) is ruled out: it would let the
  extension approve tools before the loop asks, crossing the loop
  trust boundary. An extension holds loop-level trust, not tool-level
  trust (section 10)
- **The ext_status growth bound: the log is unbounded, memory is
  capped.** The session log is the audit record: no cap on
  `ext_status` events there. The TUI's in-memory view caps at 128
  distinct ids, oldest-updated out first; the statusline consumes the
  capped map through the tick payload
- **Per-op timeouts beyond transform: a status staleness bound.** A
  status extension that gives no valid reply for three tick intervals
  (3 x tick_ms) drops its row to a stale hint. The bound runs from
  the last valid reply. The first reply of a generation gets a wider
  10 s window: a cold start is not a stuck extension. A slow reply is
  not a stuck one either: a tick reply must never wait on slow
  external work. The reference statuslines refresh git in the
  background (a bash job, a Rust thread) and merge the result into
  the next tick. The transform 2 s bound is unchanged
- **`order.toml`: declined for now.** The composed order stays
  alphabetical by entry name within a layer, global layer first. An
  explicit host sequence file is the escape valve if alphabetical
  order ever proves insufficient. It stays host-owned, not a
  project-visible knob

### Still open

- A LaTeX renderer binary for `inline:latex` spans. The host
  detection and request path landed with the stage 3 mechanism; until
  a renderer exists, the raw span shows
- Decisions made here, flagged for sign-off: hex colors allowed in
  `style`; `ext_status` suppressed from the transcript

## 12. What we borrow from deepseek-harness

- host-owned load order. The core decides the sequence
  (`packages/boot/app-boot/src/profile.ts` composes layers over an
  empty root. `apps/cli/src/plugin.ts` reconciles the layer stack and
  appends new bundles in dependency order, owned by the host)
- layered composition: base layers, then global, then project
- fail-loud misconfiguration: a listed entry without a valid patch is
  an error, not a silent skip (`profile.ts` `loadProfile`)

What we do not borrow: in-process dynamic mounting (their `node:vm`
sandbox and model-written runtime packages). Our boundary is a
process. Hot reload stays out of scope (section 9).
One consequence worth naming: their ordering is correctness, because
entries need services in sequence. Ours is presentation, because
inter-extension data flows through the log. That makes host-owned
order easier to hold here than there.

## Properties

Lean-style invariants for this spec (see `lean-driven-development.md`).

P1. fail-loud-manifest: given a malformed manifest or a broken command, observe the host refuse to start and name the offending file.
P2. load-order: given a global and a project extension of one name, observe the project entry override and the first-listed kind owner win.
P3. protocol-v: given an extension whose `protocol_v` mismatches the host, observe the host skip it and flash without starting it.
P4. per-op-fallback: given a malformed extension reply, observe the TUI stay up and revert per op: lines to the built-in render, status and row_spec to the last valid row, transformed to the raw block, append to a named reject.
P5. append-whitelist: given an `append` for a type outside `append_types`, observe the host reject it with a flash. Whitelisted types are appended through the port.
P6. restart-budget: given a repeatedly crashing extension, observe three restart attempts with 1 s, 2 s, and 4 s backoff, then a dead hint.
P7. ext-status-cap: given more than 128 distinct `ext_status` ids, observe the host drop the oldest-updated id to hold the cap.
P8. row-slot: given a row extension with content, observe the reserved row above the input box; with no row owner, or an empty spec, observe zero reserved rows; with two row owners, observe a start refusal that names both files.
